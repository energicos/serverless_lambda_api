# Serverless API Gateway with RDS

[TOC]



## 1. Background Info

- we are developing a microservice-based Business Platform running solely on AWS
- all our deployments are Cloudformation based, we dont deploy Resources into Dev/ Prod Environment via Console
- the stacks are being launched using AWSCLI Commands
- to connect to the backend resources we implement a “multi-API-Gateway under on domain” - approach involving basepathmapping in our Cloudformation stacks 
- the API-Gateway configuration is being delivered by a Swagger (OpenAPI) file which is being uploaded onto an s3 bucket and used during stack deployment as source for the API definition
- the API access is being secured by a Cognito based Authorizer which uses a Cognito pool (Cognito stack)



## 2. Scope of delivery

| __Results__              | __Description__                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Documentation            | A documentation describing the resources and the approach as well as the elaborations on the lambda/ nodejs code |
| Cloudformation templates | Cloudformation templates with the resources working as expected in an automated way (rds, lambda, cognito, Api Gateway, IAM) |
| nodejs index.js          | indexjs files containing the code for the lambda functions   |



## 3. Details of the assignment

- the goal is to create a Cloudformation stack/ nested stack 
- the stacks must be created as `yaml` files
- the stack shall allow serverless CRUD operations on a RDS (mariaDB) resource acting as backend
- the stack(s) shall deploy an API Gateway which allows us to add, update, delete, and search for accounts using a Swagger API definition loaded from an s3 bucket (see example below)

```yaml
  Api:
    Type: AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi
    Properties:
      Description: .....
      Name: !Ref RestApiName
      ApiKeySourceType: !Ref ApiKeySourceType
      Body:
        Fn::Transform:
          Name: AWS::Include
          Parameters:
            Location: !Sub "s3://bucketname/swagger.yaml"
      EndpointConfiguration:
        Types:
          - !Ref EndpointConfiguration
      FailOnWarnings: true
      MinimumCompressionSize: !Ref minimumCompressionSize
```

- the API Gateway must be secured via Cognito User Pool
- the Cognito-based Authorizer shall be embedded into the Swagger Definition and being used on the methods GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for the Lambda-path
- create a skeleton framework for the API, with the paths and methods needed to accomplish the basics of reading and writing data
- the data shall be stored in a RDS (MySQL), and served up via Lambda functions, through the API Gateway
- use a simple **accounts** database, consisting of 2 tables
  - accounts
  - user
- the tables shall be build with an SQL script like the following using Lambda and Cloudformation (after the stack has created the RDS Resource)

```mssql
CREATE TABLE `accounts` (
  `item_id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`account_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
```

- the business logic shall be setup in AWS Lambda for reading, and writing data to the relational database
- create Lambda functions based on a node.js runtime
- create one lambda function for each method and make each method work properly with the Lambda function

- we want to have the basic CRUD operations for the API
  - the ability to get all records from the database (Search accounts)
  - be able to insert new records (add accounts)
  - be able to get a single record (get accounts)
  - be able to update a single record (update accounts)
  - be able to delete records (delete accounts)



## 4. Technology Stack

The following technologies are mandatory and cannot be replaced by any other technology similar or not without our explicit approval:

- **Devops-Technologies**
  - AWS API Gateway as the API layer
  - AWS Cognito
  - AWS Lambda
  - AWS RDS MySQL
  - Node.js as runtime for the Lambda function used for this API
  - alternatively python 3 can be used along with the newest boto3 (with proper deployment package)
  - OpenAPI definition
  - postman to check the API



## 5. Code repository

- we provide a repository named "serverless_api_rds"
- Fork the repository and work inside your own account
- Give access to `jprivillaso@gmail.com` and `aerioeus@gmail.com` so we can track your work
- arrange your code like this

```shell
--api-masterstack
  |__api_rds.yaml
--nodejs
  |__index.js
--swaggerapis
  |__swagger.yaml
```

- Create a Pull Request and we will review the code
